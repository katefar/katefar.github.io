                <p> The parameters were typographically redesigning a vinyl for an album of our choice, including the front and back covers, the inside where all lyrics had to be laid out, and the label on the vinyl itself. I decided to redesign an album by Mac Miller, Swimming. I drew my concept of the warped/wavy type on the front cover from the psychedelic nature of the music, as well as the obvious reference to water, with the title being Swimming, that I incorporated beneath the stylized text. I went through several iterations of color and distortions that I did by hand until I settled on this one.</p>

                <div class="left">
                    <p>After designing all the elements, I printed everything full scale and carefully constructed the album using chipboard. I used 3 boards, each 12.5" x 12.5". One was for the front and the other two were for the back side which was doubled to create the pocket for the vinyl. I concealed all the chipboard with the extra bleeds that I folded around all the edges to create a seamless and cohesive final product. Lastly, I placed my label on an existng vinyl record. </p>
